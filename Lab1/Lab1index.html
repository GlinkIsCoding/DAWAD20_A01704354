            <article><p>This album introduced everyone to the unique and fantastic world OMAM (Of Monsters and Men) created, drawing influence from their Icelandic origins, being notorious for their sweet folk sound and mountain-indie upbeat hymns.</p></article>

                        <td>Little Talks: this song was the band's first major hit and what they're mostly known for. The video follows the story of a flying ship crew that encounters an other-worldly girl apparently looking for home. She joins their journey and protects them from the gigantic beasts that surround those mysterious lands.</td>

                        <td>King and Lionheart: the female lead singer of the band, Nanna Bryndis Hilmarsdottir, wrote this song in a way of putting into music her life experience of the moment her father and mother separated, and how his younger brother went to move far away with his father. The video is a mirroring of that, presenting to siblings being captured in war and managing to escape through this nordic-inspired, weird, and fantastic world.</td>

            <article><p>As many fans quickly noticed, the first album revolved around the 'monsters' theme, and fantastic worlds. But the band's name still was to talk about 'men'. Beneath The Skin is the band's come-back with a darker aura, approaching much more into human insecurities, feelings, and thoughts; what lies beneath the skin.</p></article>

                        <td>Crystals: this song is the lead single of the band's sophomore album. In the music video we see the band themselves in an infinite-laboratory setting, adding magic and science to give life to something. Mystery and abstract lyrics are still present in every song, and the way they are put in the energetic Crystals is without doubt, remarkable. This era is also distinctive because of the beautiful lyric videos that accompanied every song. A raw emotion is put into it by a different person the whole song each video.</td>

                        <td>Wolves Without Teeth: although this song doesn't roam far away from the band's usual sound, the official music video stands out among the others because it is fantastical in a whole different way. In a real way. The video follows the practices and competition of a dance couple. Throughout the video the contrast between the world and this couple is felt and seen. We're able to look at the synergy and the loving way they complement each other, which is what the song is about.</td>

            <article><p>FEVER DREAM, just released on July of this year, sees the band change the rules of their own game. Moving away from the folky, indie sound they are known for, they seek to expand their own limits by joining forces with synths and a fresh alternative sound. While keeping the abstract lyrics and astonishing melodies, it is Of Monsters and Men in a world of color, clouds, and infinite skies.</p></article>

                        <td>Alligator: without doubt, the curiosity in every fan sparked as soon as the song started the first time they heard it. The lead single of FEVER DREAM is the only one with an official video so far, and it features the band in a strange hotel-like setting, with surreal scenes and Nanna being a reptilian-like being. The refreshed energy of the band can be felt throughout the song and the explosion of color in the accompanying lyric video as well.</td>
